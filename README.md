# My Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal and highly opinionated Neovim configuration. I believe that in the modern Neovim ecosystem, plugins and configurations are closely intertwined. This has inspired me to create my own set of configurations, tailored to my specific needs and preferences.

This repository is not intended for public use, but rather as a personal project. However, feel free to copy, modify, or use any part of this configuration at your own risk. I am always open to suggestions and ideas for improvement.

## Goals

My primary goal with this project is to learn programming through a hands-on approach. I believe that fine-tuning my own text editor, the programmer's essential tool, is an excellent way to learn. By customizing my editor, I not only learn how to code but also gain a deeper understanding of my own development environment.

My second, equally important goal, is to port my existing minimalist Neovim configuration and thoroughly refactor it. This involves a deliberate effort to eliminate any "bloatware" – unnecessary features or dependencies often introduced by larger plugins – and to streamline the configuration to precisely fit my workflow and preferences. The aim is to create an efficient, lean, and highly performant editor setup that enhances my productivity without compromising on functionality. This process allows me to deeply understand each component of my editor and ensure that every line of configuration serves a specific, well-defined purpose.
