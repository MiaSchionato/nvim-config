# Welcome 
This is my highly-opinated Neovim config.
Since in modern neovim plugins and configs are basically the same(or plugins are basically someone else's configs), I decided to create my own set of configs, or plugins. 

This repo is not intend to public use as it'll fit and set my own preferences and needs, but feel free to copy/modify or use anything that you find here. At your own risk. 

My intention is not to satisfy anyone else's opinion but mine. Althought I am and always will be open to suggestions and upgrades.

## Goals

My goal is to learn programming taking a hands-on approach to it, and fine-tunning my own text editor, the programmer's working tool, is by far one of the best way to learn it. At least in my opinion. Since every thing that happens inside a computer is code, and the metalanguage behind all that, is that you code inde of code. From code.
So there's no better way to not only learn how to code but at the same time learn your own environment by coding your own editor, at least fine-tunning yours, in my case.
